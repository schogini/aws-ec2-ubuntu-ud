Kubernetes 101, we will cover kubectl, Pods, Volumes, and multiple containers

https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/master/content/en/docs/tutorials

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: redis-persistent-storage
      mountPath: /data/redis
  volumes:
  - name: redis-persistent-storage
    emptyDir: {}


Volume Types
EmptyDir: Creates a new directory that exists as long as the Pod is running on the node, 
	but it can persist across container failures and restarts.
HostPath: Mounts an existing directory on the node’s file system. 
	For example (/var/logs).





Note that we have also added a Volume here. In this case, the Volume is mounted into both containers. It is marked readOnly in the web server’s case, since it doesn’t need to write to the directory.

Finally, we have also introduced an environment variable to the git-monitor container, which allows us to parameterize that container with the particular git repository that we want to track.


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: www
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /srv/www
      name: www-data
      readOnly: true
  - name: git-monitor
    image: kubernetes/git-monitor
    env:
    - name: GIT_REPO
      value: http://github.com/some/repo.git
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /data
      name: www-data
  volumes:
  - name: www-data
    emptyDir: {}
